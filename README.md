# TeamSpeak-MusicBot
Teamspeak music bot for Ubuntu 12.04

This script will attempt to install and configure all of the required files to run a Web Based Teamspeak music bot via Ubuntu 12.04 running on a stand alone server.

I have only tested it with Ubuntu 12.04. Changes to the script will continue to be made and should eventually work to run on Ubuntu 14.04.
